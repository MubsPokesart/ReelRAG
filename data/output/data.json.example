And there's a new you on the block that you want to showcase to everybody. First thing you got to do is just reconnect with the person one way or another, whether it's over text or phone call and see where they're at. See if the conversation is even worth having. A simple hay house, everything been going, goes a long way. And then same thing i always talk about. Ask about what they have going on and be sincerely interested. Because it's been a while and they probably did a lot over that time period where you didn't talk to them. Number three is super critical. You got to stand your ground on where you're at. Don't let the new version of you waver. See the new version of you 100%. And also know that it's okay to tell them that you're becoming a new person and that you've made some changes. Because people appreciate the genuine side of you more than the phone version of you. And the last part is know that the right people will find you. Not everyone is going to the new you and that's okay. I'd rather be pleased with myself than try to please the whole world. Because it's not going to happen. Follow for more value."

His youtube video has such beautiful animations and he's even able to explain complex topics in a very clear and concise way. I watched one bite bite go video a day during my time in amazon and i also subscribed to his newsletter. And just about six months i was able to start applying all these concepts that i learned to my actual software engineering job. This is a very simple and effective way to start uploading yourself if you're a junior software engineer through free online content on youtube. Number two is going to be nikko dio. Nikko dio single-handedly care my data structures and algorithms and interview prep. And he is the main reason i was able to pass an amazon technical interview. He has really go walk through videos on leaco questions that i wrote in the python and the way i explained and caused his solutions that we should evenly and agree with what technical interview. Whenever people ask me for interview prep advice, i always recommend them to do the nikko on 50 and to watch his walk through videos. Number three is going to be theo. Theo is a very popular software engineering content creator on youtube that goes into more senior software engineering topics and tech news. If you want to learn what it takes to talk to an sf tech bro in a startup road, theo is a guy that you want to watch. He teaches assistant design in a software engineering but not in a traditional way. He talks about his experience at a startup founder and as a software engineer and his opinions and breakdowns on tech news and tech companies. So you just naturally learn about system design in software engineering and a tech world through all these stories and breakdowns. Theo teaches you how to be street smart in a tech world through his personal experience in real world examples while people by by going to nikko dio teaches how to be book smart. By teaching you the real system design and data structure and algorithms concepts."

Here are three questions you can ask to make sure that you're remembered after your coffee chats. One, ask something that'll get them to talk about their own personal experience. Information that you can't really find online. What's the most surprising thing that you found working in this industry? question that will lead them to share insights that you can't really find off google. Two, ask something that'll make them think about their past experiences. What's the skill that you wish you developed? a question that can plan out a roadmap for your career and it shows that you're thinking strategically. Three, this is a must-ask. Who else would you recommend i speak with? that one question will turn one coffee chat into five, five into 25, and so on and so forth. Stop asking questions that you can google and start asking ones that'll build a relationship. All from rezips."

Your focus way too much on what you need to say to them to get them to you. But the real trick is to take the focus off yourself and put it on them. And what i mean by that digs into number two and i always say to show genuine interest to other people. But what would it chilled out person do in that situation? do it ask questions that you're curious about. Not the questions that you think will make them connect with you better. See that doesn't make sense at all. So someone's yeah, i'm studying business. Simple thing that. You're what got you into business? did you just choose it because that's what all the bros are doing today? or did you love saving money in your piggy bank growing up? so many questions come to mind and those are the types of questions that you should feel comfortable asking people because it shows that you're genuine. Number three, one of the biggest problems i see today is mind your face. That blows my mind even seeing other people in conversation how miserable they look. You want to build connection, be more charismatic, bite it up a little, get this thing moving and smile. Last one, even all the stuff that i've said already, you want to be human as well. You don't have to be perfect. You just stay loose and don't try to be someone you're not bring your own stuff. Genuinness is cool. You know what else is cool? following me, hit the follow. You get really good with people, i promise you."

So what is the most out of pocket where you reach out to professor to get a research opportunity? he wasn't really responding to my emails, so i just showed up to his class and i just talked to him and what is the key to creating a great cold email then? the repressors want to reply to. So if you mentioned that you want to go to grad school after, there are a lot more willing to respond because they also want students from their group to go to grad school because it looks good on them. What is your biggest tip if you want to get a research opportunity at a school that you don't even go to? so there's this thing called research experience for undergraduates. A lot of universities have them where you can get paid to do research and you can live on campus the whole summer. It's also a great networking opportunity because you get to meet all these other students that are also just as motivated as you. So among all the best researchers that you know, what is the one thing that they all have in common? they're not complacent with the current research positions they have, they're always curious, they're willing to pick up new skills and volunteer for things that other people in the group might not be doing."

You just need to win over the gatekeeper. And every group, there's always going to be one person. You kind of know of maybe not well, but well enough to just think what's up. That's your entry point. And here's how you're going to do it. First, give them value, help them with something. Gas them up and public. We're in front of a girl. Make them feel good. Next, let that favor sit in. Then ask for a simple invite. Yo, are you going to that thing on friday? keep it very casual. Next, if you're going to invite it, you're at the group head. You do zero talking about yourself. Instead, yo, ask questions. Bring some drinks. Bring people if you're allowed. You become the glue. And finally, you wait. You'll be patient because when you see these three signs, you'll know you're now in the group. One, they start asking you to come. Two, start getting tagged in group stories. Three, when you show up, people say, yo, you made it. At which point, you make the final move. You host. Once you plant something and they show up, you've gone from an outsider to a whole number of that group."

Don't have a preset list of questions that you've come up with based off of researching the linkedin profile and you're asking them everything from their study abroad to the work history. Questions is end up being all over the place and you're not engaging in a conversation. Number three, always try to add value. Sometimes there's just not that much you can do. The easiest way where you can add value is make whoever you're talking to feel they didn't waste their time helping you.

So what i mean by that is of course you don't always align perfectly or have perfect conversation with everybody but i think it's really important to be able to have an understanding about them beyond just professional. I feel if you know something they went abroad or in college for example or you went to a similar college as them or you're from the same hometown. Finding middle ground is so important and being able to speak about that a little bit creates connection and that goes so far beyond just a regular coffee chat where you're just talking about professionalism and i will also add that i think a lot of people have the same set of questions because maybe you're going into one specific industry for every single professional that they talk to and i feel it's kind of at this point you know the answer to the questions. I just feel of course maybe there's variance depending on company but i do feel very strongly that if you don't care about the question you're asking you don't need to ask it. I feel if you can be really specific that's super important and ask questions that you're genuinely interested in you want to be gaining from a coffee chat if you're just there to get a referral i get it but i also think ask questions that you'll really gain from. So yeah and then i'd also say that people love to talk about themselves and about things that really matter to them. Of course work matters but i'll go back to the banter thing really quickly if you can ask them about the first minute of the conversation and be oh how is your weekend whatever and if you can ask follow a question that's great too and i'll also add that i feel so much at the time coffee chats are just question answer question answer question answer and there's nothing more i feel unappealing just because it feels probably to the person on the other end that you're not even listening to what they're saying you just have an agenda of your own that you want to share or prove so i feel if you can ask a follow-up to the question that you just asked based on their answer that really shows you're attentively listening and really taking what they say and understanding it. So yeah, i hope that helps."

Let me break down the exact steps to take before moving day that will set you both up for success instead of conflict. Step number one, start meaningful conversations before you meet in person. Don't just exchange basic info, ask about sleep schedules, study habits, cluddlingness, expectations, and guest policies. Feel free to also do a video call to get a feel for their personality and communication style. Step number two, discuss practical living arrangements and boundaries upfront. Who's bringing what made your items, how you'll handle shared expenses if there are any bathroom schedules, noise levels during study time, and overnight guest policies. Having awkward conversations over text is way easier than face-to-face conflicts later. Step number three, coordinate room setup and shared items to avoid duplicates. Create a shared google doc, listing who brings the mini fridge, vacuum, cleaning supplies, plan your room layout together, and discuss decoration styles that you don't clash completely on moving day. And last but not least prepare for adjustment period while staying optimistic."

I'm an expert in this topic and i'm going to tell you all of my secrets. I routinely lose 20 pounds in just a couple of months. The first thing you have to know is that the only way you're going to lose weight fast is by dropping your calories incredibly low. Throughout my weight loss phase, i was eating 1600 calories every single day. And you have to understand that if you drop your calories this low, you have to do it the right way. The right way, meaning you have to get in enough healthy fat, specifically omega-3s, maxing out omega-3s helps regulate your hormones so you don't feel shit on such low calories. And if you're looking for exact numbers, follow this blueprint i'm about to give you. At least one gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you're 150 pounds, you eat 150 grams of protein. For carbs, i do about 0. 75 grams per pound of body weight. This is kind of just a target. If i go under it for the day, it's not a big deal. If i go over it for the day, not a big deal. And for fats, i kind of keep them as low as i can while still getting in enough omega-3s. My favorite source is salmon. And at the end of the day, i always end up somewhere around 40 grams of fat. Again, same thing with fat as it is with carbs if i go under or over, not a big deal. But one thing that's not negotiable is my protein in my omega-3s. I get those every single day. If you follow this method, you're going to lose at least two pounds a week and feel good and still maintain your strength."

        "transcription": "Here's how to build deep connection with anybody if you're an expert communicator. Talk about a lot of basics in my videos, we're going to go beyond that today. To really dig into connection. And human connection is all about emotion. Not just talking surface level, we got to dig a little bit. Questions what was that for you? how are you feeling about all that? how has that been going for you? rather than just going conversation topic to topic, you want to dig into what the other person's thinking about and feeling. Second one, and very often overlooked, when you don't understand what the other person said, ask for clarity. Someone's i was at the rfg yesterday doing pottery. I'd be what is the rfg? not in a mean way, but ask for clarity because it shows that you're really trying to understand what they did. It's a sign of respect and maturity. Third thing, don't be afraid to share your own experience and get vulnerable. Connection is a two way street. And if we want other people to open up because we're asking all these questions about their thoughts and emotions, we can't expect to leave them out hanging. We got to also give our own stuff. The last one, if you really want to connect with people, you have to know your audience. Talking to a mentor is different from talking to a friend, is different than talking to a parent. You got to understand that and how you use your language, how you use your body, how you use your facial expression, and think about how is this going to come off to the other person? how can i deliver this best or show that i'm listening best? want to get really good with people? go ahead and hit that follow."

You start by building a machine learning model with scikit-learn or the random forest classifier. And if you want to familiarize yourself with these models, you could start by going to this website called mluxplain. They have all these really cool visualizations for all the different models you would need. So let's say for example, the random forest classifier, you could just dive in and then go and visually learn these complicated subjects, which i find so helpful. And if you prefer to learn a bit more hands-on by coding something, you could start learning how to build the predictor model with this youtube video. It's pretty good and i love their channel. Now after you have that model built out, all you need to do is find a data set on kaggle and then train your model on that data set and build out a full stack app so users can interact with. It will look great on your resume."

First, i introduce myself and i explain a little bit about why i wanted to do that coffee chat. So what specifically about the other person i'm interested in? then i ask them to introduce themselves and include anything that might stand out to them. Finally, i start going down a list of questions i've prepared by looking at their linkedin and their background online. It really helps to ask specific questions about things you've seen online. And even if you think it might seem a little bit stalkery, trust me. The other person really appreciates that you've prepared questions and looked into their experiences instead of them having to explain it themselves. How you end the conversation is really up to you, but i to ask something about their future plans and where they see their career going. That's how i kind of to wrap up the loose ends of the conversation and end on a very forward looking note.

You do need to show your appreciation for them taking on the extra work it was to train you, teach you, and give you opportunities to learn that summer. And this is the best way to show appreciation without putting yourself in an uncomfortable position. I'm going to write a handwritten thank you note. And i can talk about what exactly you can say in the thank you note, but these are the people i would be sure to give a thank you note to. When it comes to handwritten notes, you should write one to every single person on your team, junior to senior, and you should write one to the executive assistant or secretary who's attached to your team. This will be massively helpful when you go back full time. You should also write one to any mentor you were assigned, even if you only met with them once and also anyone who you got a coffee chat with more than two times. If you feel a thank you note isn't enough for these people, you should write a thank you note and buy them coffee on the last day. I think that's more than enough. If you're a baker and you've talked about this to your team, it's up to a baked good for this. I can talk about what exactly you should put in the thank you note and what you should do for people you're not writing a thank you note to because there are other messages and emails you should be sending towards the end of your internship. But this is a great place to start, and i can give work appropriate stationary if necessary, because the thing i spend a ton of money on is stationary. I'm obsessed."

I see some version of this all the time. I hate liking someone. I always feel i you more than you me as 42, 000 likes. I don't know when this came about in the culture, but there's this real terror of being in any kind of a relationship where you feel they're getting more out of it than you are. It's a zero sum game. It's a balance that has to be maintained. And it completely ignores the possibility of something that is basic to the human life, which is that making someone else happy can make you happy. For every bad relationship or even bad friendship i've ever seen has had the same problem. Where you'll hear them complaining well, they went and did something fun and i wasn't available. That's not fair. Or the opposite, something terrible happened to me. I came home and told them about it and they weren't all that upset. They are obligated to have the same bad experience i had or else there's an imbalance. I suffered. They didn't. I tried to push my suffering onto them and they didn't let me and that's bad. That's unfair. And you'll see people try to frame this as logic. They'll use a lot of therapy speak emotional labor or in defending it, they'll immediately reach for the most extreme examples of the abuser or the cheater. And maybe it's that fear of the worst case scenario that's at the heart of this. If i love this person too much then they're going to take advantage of me. But eventually it reaches this point where you see all relationships as a conflict or a competition. Where if you were ever asked to do something that you'd prefer not to do that that is some form of abuse. Where sacrifice isn't always will be one of the core elements of love. If there's some household tasks that you know your partner hates so you do it and take joy in knowing that you spared them from having to do it. Where if you're only thought as okay now they owe me one i think you're already doomed because that's just a transaction and you can do that with a stranger."

Maybe somebody told you a fun little fact about them. Oh, my dog has the same name as my favorite singer or something. Acknowledge what they just said. Oh, is that right? that's cool. That's interesting. I love that. Give them some kind of indication that you heard what they said. Let them know that you're listening and that you're active in the conversation. And that will encourage them to share more with you. Step two, ask relevant questions. They just shared with you about their dog. Oh, what kind of dog do you have or they just share with you about what they do for work? what got you into that? what did you do before that? how long do you go throughout the day and nobody asks you about you? i spend all day wanting to talk about me, but nobody asks. Be that person that asks the questions. Number three, as the conversation progresses, this person knows, hey, they're listening. I can trust them. That's when you start adding anecdotes. Tell them a little bit about you. They may not ask questions about you, but by the time it ends, they're going to be hmm, i don't know anything about that person because they didn't tell me anything. And by the end of it all, if you've taken the time to build, ask, and share, and the conversation is still not going where you want it to, go ahead and end it. Hey, it was great talking to you. I'll see you later. Maybe i'll see you later. Whatever. Walk away. You did all you can do. Not every conversation is going to go how you want it to. And that's okay. But most importantly, practice, practice, practice, practice. I have a 14-day challenge on my page. It's at the top. Click on it. You get to practice different habits for strengthening conversation and building confidence, talking to new people. So i hope this helps."

Ops students are getting invited to direct consideration programs, which means that they can skip all the way to the final round. Students usually get invited via email, get to attend exclusive events where there are recruiters and hiring managers, and then they get to skip the online assessment and go directly to the final round interview. We are not even in august yet. Another trend that i'm seeing is invite only application-based networking events. Greylock, adobe students on the aws, the gap between the best students, the most prepared students, and the least prepared students is just getting wider and wider. I'm also seeing applications open and close in less than a week. Some opportunities have already closed. Pinterest apprentice your program. Sales force apm internship. Not only that, but applications are closing before the deadline, which means that waiting until the deadline is really risky. I'm talking to some program directors right now who are talking about closing their applications early because they're just getting so many applications. So what does this need to be doing right now? first is to keep a close eye on your emails, check every single day. Students are damning me about missing opportunities and asking what they can do about it. Your best bet is to respond to the recruiter that you've been working with and ask them if they're still in opening for an event. But again, there's no guarantee you have to be checking your email every single day. Second, polish your resume right now so that you can be ready to apply when the application's open. People often ask me how i get all the latest information on these programs. Well, it's because i proactively befriend recruiter and hiring managers. My friends are also startup founders who are hiring. And that's how i get my latest information. I share it on my instagram stories and on my stuff sack."

I use this exact framework to help me get seven internships in college, including at goldman sachs and private equity firms. Here's what most people get wrong. They think coffee chats are about gathering information. They're not. They're about trying to get the other person to one, you, and then two, remember you. Once they you, it's going to be easy for them to vouch for you and refer you. Step one. Ask about their hiring process. Instead of asking just about their day to day work, ask about how they think about their junior team. How do you guys tend to think about your junior roles? what does the recurring process tend to look for junior team members? this positions you in their head as someone that's looking to join the team, and not somebody just asking random questions. Step two. Express genuine interest. After they explain their process, say, i'd be interested in meeting more people and getting involved in the process if possible. What do you recommend as next steps? this less them suggests referrals or introductions naturally without you having to make the awkward ask. Step three. If they don't offer next steps, you can use the backup ask. Would you be willing to introduce me to someone on the team because i would love to still learn more? this gives them an easy way to help you, even if they can't or don't want to refer you. Remember, none of this works if they don't you. Focus on being genuine and interested in this person as a human. Ask follow up questions about their answers. Tell stories and be memorable."

If you're reestablishing yourself in some capacity, it's more often than not for the better. So amazing, you're being your true self and you're trying to improve. First step in this whole process is to set the guidelines for how you're going to identify yourself. Maybe you're trying to lose weight, maybe you want to change your personality. It doesn't matter what it is, but it might be helpful to write it down just so that you know that you have that north star. That's your new identity. The important thing after you knowing it is tell other people around you because those who are your true rider dies are going to support you or hold you accountable for whatever it is that you're doing. Now at the start, this is going to be uncomfortable. Of course it is, all change is. So you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable while keeping in mind what your new identity is so that you don't lose sight of it and fall back on the old patterns. Now along the way, you're going to find some wonderful people who align with you, the new you and or stuck with you for the ride. Congratulations, you have your true friends and family. Now your brand new identity, go forth and prosper. If we haven't met yet, i'm andrew. I help young guys excel in all walks of life. And if you want to see me talk to the camera every single day, go ahead and hit that follow."

I feel stuff that gets really overlooked because now everything's remote and not everyone's doing that so i think it's an easy way to stand out and recently i met with someone who i knew was treating me to a coffee so instead i was meeting them in person so i brought them a book i noticed that they really to read so i bought them a book from their favorite genre and i feel it just shows them that you value their time and all the advice that they give you and lastly send them a thank you obviously. That's the bare minimum, but i would definitely go into detail in the thank you about why you appreciated everything that they said or what you appreciated because i feel that also shows that you were attentively listening and really took what they said to heart. Yeah."

        "transcription": "If you're a summer intern and you have a few weeks left of your internship and you're a little bit nervous, you're not going to get a return offer. First of all, congrats on being humble. Every single intern should be hedging their bets in case they don't get a return offer. But these are the things i think you should do in the final weeks of your internship to de-stress yourself in case you don't get that offer. As a summer intern, i was well liked. I ended up going back to that company in no way was i not interviewing other places, leading up to getting that offer. In a better position, then you will be in a few weeks before you guarantee you don't have an offer because the company is that you can reach out to don't know that you're reaching out from a position of lacking an offer. What i mean by that is log into your company's equivalent of workday, indeed, linkedin, whatever it is, and email the companies that have early recruiting cycles in september. These are probably going to be consulting firms or big four equivalents, maybe even banks. I just email them and say, hey, i really the firm. I'm not 100% sure it's the best fit for me or that i'm going to have the opportunities to learn in the first two years after school that i'm looking for, would you be open to interviewing this summer? don't need to say anything about you not getting a return offer. You are coming in with a position of leverage that you have an offer from this other firm that you're trying to speed up this other cycles process. Some companies might say no, i had one of the big consulting firms say no undergrads from your school are supposed to accept offers until october. I don't know what they were thinking, but i eventually convinced them i was well, that's super fine. No problem at all because all of these companies and all these hr people have fomo. Your goal here is to use the offer that you may or may not be getting come mid-august to get an offer or to at least start the recruiting process with comparable firms earlier on. You really your firm, but you're nervous that you're not going to get an offer at your same firm. You can reach out to lester's hourful locations. They're probably will be a spot for you in one of these. Just remember that if you're an intern, you can still turn things around in your final three weeks. It's not the end of the earth if you've made mistakes and you've shown that you learned from those mistakes. And if you're at a company that has always expected perfection from day one, you should take a step back and question if that's a company that's going to allow you to grow in a productive manner that's not going to make you super anxious in the year after you go back because you don't have to go back to any company you interned at just because it's the safest option. You can reneg, i've had friends reneg and go to the top three consulting companies in the world. So it'll be fine."
